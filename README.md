# MolecularWeight Pro

**Precise molecular mass calculation & chemical lookup.**

MolecularWeight Pro is a sleek, portable, and dependency-free web application designed for chemists, researchers, and students. It provides fast and accurate molecular weight calculations, chemical property lookups, and buffer preparation tools.

## ✨ Key Features

- **MW Calculator**: 
    - Calculate molecular weight by formula (e.g., `H2O`, `C6H12O6`) or name (e.g., `Aspirin`).
    - Powered by local formula parsing and PubChem API integration.
    - View mass composition breakdown and element details.
    - Automatic fetching of 2D structures, synonyms, and solubility data.
    - Recent calculation history stored locally.

- **Buffer Calculator**:
    - Easily calculate required amounts for final solution volumes.
    - Supports multiple solutes simultaneously.
    - Intelligent auto-lookup for Molecular Weight based on chemical name or formula.
    - Supports various concentration units: M, mM, uM, % (w/v), and Dilution (X).

## 🚀 Getting Started

MolecularWeight Pro is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It requires no installation or build steps.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Custom design system with glassmorphism effects and dynamic background animations.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Logic for formula parsing, unit conversions, and API communication.
- **PubChem PUG REST API**: For external chemical data lookup.
